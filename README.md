📊 MarketMinds

MarketMinds is an AI-powered financial chatbot that answers complex market and company-related questions by combining real financial data with company reports using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Think of it as a junior financial analyst that never gets tired.


🚀 What It Does

MarketMinds allows users to ask natural language questions like:

“How did Apple perform in its last earnings call?”

“Summarize the key risks mentioned in Tesla’s annual report.”

“Compare Infosys and TCS based on recent financials.”

The system intelligently decides whether to:

fetch live/structured market data,

search company reports (PDFs), or

combine both to generate a grounded, context-aware response.
